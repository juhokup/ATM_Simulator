# ATM_Simulator

This is a 90's theme inspirated ATM machine simulator which was made using QT(c++), MySql and REST API.
Default withdrawing currency has been set to EUR, but withdrawing USD, GBP, SEK and JPY have also been made possible by fetching dailu pdated currency rates from online.

This project was developed to be used with an RFID card reader (in our case-> Olimex MOD-RFID125) but card number entry box can easily be modified into mainWindow interface.
