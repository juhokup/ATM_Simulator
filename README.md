# ATM_Simulator

This is a 90's theme-inspired ATM simulator that was made using QT (c++), MySQL, and the REST API. Default withdrawing currency has been set to EUR, but withdrawing USD, GBP, SEK, and JPY has also been made possible by fetching daily pdated currency rates online.

This project was developed to be used with an RFID card reader (in our case, Olimex MOD-RFID125), but the card number entry box can easily be modified into the main window interface.

We have made a project presentation video in Finnish, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkHBmaDQrq8
